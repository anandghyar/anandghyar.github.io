    My HTML page on stuck and I was unable to scroll down the age page. I have done some research and goggle the
    possible errors but nothing worked out. Finally, I went through the indentation of the code and tidy up my code.
    While checking the codes step by step I realize that I have closed the code incorrectly and after fixing that issue,
    the page start scrolling up and down again.
    The main thing I learned is not to give up. Just repeating the same process and focusing on the basics can solve the
    problem and also googling is great but may not help in all the scenarios.

  </p>

  <h3>Now a time where you solved a problem in an elegant way:
  </h3>

  <p>
    In one of the challenges, I overwrite the code and make it complicated, in this scenario, rewrite the code by
    deleting one I have was very helpful. Taking one step back helps me to think differently. I learned the lesson to
    keep things simple. Also, realize that simple functions can save few lines of code.

  <h3><i>Problem-solving techniques: </i> </h3>

  <p>
    <b>Pseudocode:</b>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It helps you understand the problem by divide the problem into small stages which makes more sense in the code. It
    gives you a pathway to translate the code.

  </p>
 
  <p>
    <b>Rubber ducky method:</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeating it back step by step helps me to figure out the issue during my learning process and I like this
    . It's like when we try to teach something to somebody eventually you also get better at it.
  </p>
  
  <P>
  <b>Googling: </b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Googling is the best as you can use keyword and check other relevant problems or someone else who come across the same problem as you. I use this technique frequently.
   
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Reading error messages:</b>
  </p>
 <p>It helps you figure out the root cause of the problem and may lead to debugging the issue.
 </p>
 
<p>
  <b>Asking peers to help:</b>
</p>
<p>
  I havenâ€™t ask peers for help in my cohort, but I do approach people in the circle who are good at technology. However, I will not hesitate to ask for help during Bootcamp if needed.
</p>
 
<p> <b>Asking coaches for help :</p></b>
<p>Once I tried all possible options and unable to find any solution on google, then I will ask coaches. I will use this option more during Bootcamp.
