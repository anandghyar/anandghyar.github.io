      Strengths
    </p>
    <p>
      I am excellent manager of day-to-day tasks and routine maintenance and make sure that those who are close to me
      are well cared for.
      I have a strong sense of responsibility and strive to meet my obligations, though this may sometimes be more from
      a sense of social expectations than intrinsic drive.
      I am always loyal and trustworthy and true pillars of any groups I belong to – whether it is their family or a
      community club, people can always be relied upon me. I seek harmony and care deeply about other people’s feelings,
      being careful not to offend or hurt anybody. I’m strong team player.
    </p>

    <p>
      Describe your core personal values.
    </p>
    <p>
      The core personal values I hold are compassion, kindness, and honesty to myself and others. Also respecting other
      people, different opinion and point of views.
    </p>
