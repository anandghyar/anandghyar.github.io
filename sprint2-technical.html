  <h3> <b>Use an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and Javascript </b> </h3>

  <style>
       body {
        background-color:  rgb(224, 221, 221);
    }

    .cs1 {
      display: block;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      width: 35%;
      
    }

    h3 {
      color: red; 
    }

    p {
      color: black;
    }

    img {
      display: block;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
      width: 50%;
    }
  </style>

  <p>
    We can use it to compare the HTML, CSS, and Javascript to the human anatomy.HTML would be your body parts, holding
    everything together and providing a base to hang everything off. CSS is the skin. CSS is used to change the look and
    feel of websites. It is where you define your color schemes, fonts, spacing, layouts, and more. In our body analogy,
    JavaScript takes the place of brain functioning, providing ideas, techniques, and logic to our body.

  <h3>Explain control flow and loops </h3>

  <p>
    Control flow in javascript is very simple as we all know that programs are groups of code and software are groups of
    programs, so in a program, there is a block of code we have to execute again and again and for saving space we can
    not write the code again and again to avoid this problem. We use Control flow to block of code instead of writing
    again and again in the programming language.

    Loops give instructions to complete specific tasks a specific number of times and it keeps working until the number
    value is met. E.g. running practice before playing cricket. I can aim myself 5 rounds daily before starting the
    cricket game. Loop in this example is completing the running rounds and value is number 5 rounds in total

  <h3>What is the DOM? </h3>

  <p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of
    documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.

    With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add,
    modify, or delete elements and content. Anything found in an HTML or XML document can be accessed, changed, deleted,
    or added using the Document Object Model.

    In simple terms, any web page that you encounter is a document. View the document as an HTML source or in a browser
    window is just an approach of presenting one thing in different ways. The document object model (DOM) represents a
    webpage as objects to enable its manipulation. With the document-oriented model, a scripting language such as
    JavaScript may modify it by targeting the objects.

  <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects </h3>
  <p>
    Objects are mutable data structures in javascript which is used to represent a ‘Thing’. This could be anything like
    animals, persons, etc.It stores the data in key-value pair and the key can be anything except for “undefined “. 

    Arrays are objects only in javascript. The major difference is that they store the data in an ordered collection in
    which the data can be accessed using a numerical index. They are also mutable and data can be modified at any index.
    We can also remove the item from the array using the “delete” operator.
  </p>

  <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful? </h3>
  <p>
    A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of
    writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer
    to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions. The function saves time and one can avoid
    complex tasks by using functions.
