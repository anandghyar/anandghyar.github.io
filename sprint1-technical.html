      display: block;

      margin-right: auto;

  <p>
    display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on
    the available space in the containing element. It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats easier
    to create. No need to clear floats anymore.

    Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that inline-block allows to set a width and height on the
    element. Also, with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected, and with display:
    inline-block they are.

  <h3>display: inline </h3>

  <p>
    This block is used to display an element as an inline element (like <span>). The height and width properties are not
      effected on display:inline; property. It allows only left and right side of margins, not top and bottom. In simple
      words it has no line break before and after of its neighbor elements and it allows HTML next to it.

  <h3>display: Inline-block </h3>

  <p>
    This block is used to display an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an
    inline element, but it can apply height and width values. It is placed as an inline element (on the same line as
    adjacent content). It looks like an inline element but it behaves as a block element and donâ€™t force to line break.
