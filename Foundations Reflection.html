        Core learning:
     </p>
      <p>
        Three things I found helpful during core learning are emotional intelligence, growth mindset, and neuroplasticity.
I learn how learning new things can shape your brain. How your thought process and attitude shape your mindset. Also the value of emotional intelligence in day-to-day life and how it helps to become a good human being and achieve success at a professional level.
      </p>

      <p>
        Values, Empathy, and Self Awareness in Programming:
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very important to be a team player as it helps you to fit in any team. Empathy, values, and self-awareness play a very important role when you deal with your daily workload, interact with your clients, colleagues, bosses or manage a team of people with different cultures and backgrounds. “Mahi tahi” is important as you share a common goal in a team. 
       </p>
        <br> </br>
      <p>
        Core Learning Surprises:
      </p>
      <p>
        The neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset part of the core learning was very useful. I was grateful to learn this concept and it helps to keep me motivated and I'm confident that it will help me to achieve long-term goals.

        Core Learning Challenges:
      </p>
      <p>
        I think identity and values were the challenging part of core learning. Going into flashbacks and talking about choices, values, and upbringing was time-consuming for me. Also, I took a lot of time to summarise the information.
      </p>

      <p>
        EDA and Core Learning:
      </p>
      <p>
        Core learning is one of the important aspects to becoming a successful programmer as most of the tech companies look for tech skills plus attitude and interpersonal skills (team fit). 
        On the other hand, I think I spend lots of time on core learning which could be utilized to clear javascript concepts and understand the logic to use those concepts. 
        But at the end of the day, I feel both skills are equally important to grow as a successful developer.
